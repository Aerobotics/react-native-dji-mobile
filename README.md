*Please note that this project is still in its infancy. Many SDK features are not yet available, and the implementation of available features may still change. Use in your production application at your own risk!*

## Installation

Install the library to your project

```bash
npm i --save react-native-dji-mobile
```

### iOS
**Using Cocoapods (recommended)**


1. First link the library
```bash
react-native link react-native-dji-mobile
```

2. The library requires the manual installation of the DJIWidget pod, used to display live video feed from the drone.
    1. Add `use_modular_headers!` to the top of your podfile.

    2. Add the following dependency to your podfile:
    ```diff
    + pod 'DJIWidget', '~> 1.5', :modular_headers => false
      pod 'react-native-dji-mobile', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-dji-mobile'
    ```

    1. Add `:modular_headers => false` to the pod dependencies for `DoubleConversion`, `glog`, and `Folly` in your podfile.

    After applying these changes your podfile should look similar to this:
    ```ruby
    platform :ios, '9.0'

    target '[YourProjectName]' do
      use_modular_headers!

      ...

      # Pods for [YourProjectName]
      pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [
        'Core',
        'CxxBridge', # Include this for RN >= 0.47
        'DevSupport', # Include this to enable In-App Devmenu if RN >= 0.43
        'RCTText',
        'RCTNetwork',
        'RCTWebSocket', # needed for debugging
        # Add any other subspecs you want to use in your project
      ]
      # Explicitly include Yoga if you are using RN >= 0.42.0
      pod "yoga", :path => "../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga"

      # Third party deps podspec link
      pod 'DoubleConversion', :podspec => '../node_modules/react-native/third-party-podspecs/DoubleConversion.podspec', :modular_headers => false
      pod 'glog', :podspec => '../node_modules/react-native/third-party-podspecs/glog.podspec', :modular_headers => false
      pod 'Folly', :podspec => '../node_modules/react-native/third-party-podspecs/Folly.podspec', :modular_headers => false

      pod 'DJIWidget', '~> 1.5', :modular_headers => false
      pod 'react-native-dji-mobile', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-dji-mobile'

      ...

    end
    ```

3. run `pod install` to ensure the required dependencies are installed

4. To ensure that the library will build, you must add Swift support to your Xcode project:
   1. Open **ios/YourAppName.xcworkspace**
   2. Select `File > New > File...` in Xcode's menu bar or press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>.
   3. Add a new Swift file to your project, and when asked by Xcode, press **Create Bridging Header**. **Do not delete the empty swift file**.

**Manually**

If you are unable to add `use_modular_headers!` to your Podfile as it breaks your build (for instance, react-native-gesture-handler no longer compiles correctly), you can manually link the react-native-dji-mobile library to your project. Please note that this still requires the use of cocoapods to install the require DJI dependencies.

   1. Add the DJI Mobile SDK dependencies to your podfile and run `pod install`
   ```diff
   + pod 'DJI-SDK-iOS', '~> 4.10'
   + pod 'DJIWidget', '~> 1.5'
   ```

   1. Navigate to **[YourProjectName]/node_modules/react-native-dji-mobile/ios**

   2. Drag the **ReactNativeDjiMobile.xcodeproj** file into your Xcode project into the **Libraries** folder.

   3. Go to the **Link Binary With Libraries** build phase for your Xcode project, and add the **libReactNativeDjiMobile.a**.

### Android (TODO)

### Adding Logs to Android Java Code Using Android Studio

To add log statements to the Android Java code, you can do the following:

In your `.java` file, import the Android [Log](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log) package and use it to log a message with a tag:

```java
import android.util.Log;

Log.d("SomeTag", "Some message");
```

Then, in Android Studio, if you connect your device over USB, you can view the Log statements using [Logcat](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-logcat):
1. Build and run your app
2. Open Logcat in **View > Tool Windows > Logcat**
3. Filter for the tag you added to your log statement

If you need to connect your device over WIFI (which is the nominal case since the USB needs to be connected to the DJI RC remote), you can do the following:
1. Install an Android Studio WIFI ADB plugin. At the time of writing, I am using [Android WiFiADB](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13156-android-wifiadb)
2. Connect to the mobile device using the WIFI ADB plugin
3. Unplug the USB and do the same three steps above as you would if you were connected over USB.
